# Creational Design Patterns

Creational Design Patterns are a set of design patterns that provide a way to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns address various object creation problems and provide a way to create objects that is suitable for the situation.

## Problem Solved by Creational Design Patterns

The problem that Creational Design Patterns aim to solve is the complexity and inefficiency of object creation. When creating an object, it is often necessary to consider factors such as the object's class, relationships with other objects, and the cost of creating an object. Creational Design Patterns provide a simple and organized way to handle object creation.

## Examples of Creational Design Patterns

Here are three types of Creational Design Patterns:

1. Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

2. Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes.

3. Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.

- _There are many other types of creational design pattern_

Each of these patterns provides a different approach to object creation, and the choice of which pattern to use depends on the specific requirements of the application.
